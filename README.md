# Tina Hu — Frontend Engineer

Frontend engineering portfolio emphasizing system design,
predictable state, and UX edge cases.


I build maintainable, predictable frontend systems with React and TypeScript.
My focus is not feature quantity, but **architecture clarity, UX stability, and
explainable engineering decisions**.

---

## What I Focus On

- UI architecture: components stay pure, hooks manage side effects
- Predictable state: centralized auth and permission logic with guarded initialization
- UX edge cases: loading, empty, fallback, and error states
- Accessibility: keyboard flow, focus management, ESC behavior
- Responsive stability: layout remains stable under scroll/resize

## Background

Transitioned from procurement to frontend engineering.
I bring structured thinking, delivery discipline, and system-level reasoning
into frontend development.
