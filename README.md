# Tina Hu — Frontend Engineer

Frontend engineering portfolio emphasizing system design, predictable state, and UX edge cases.

I build maintainable frontend systems with React and TypeScript. My focus is not just feature quantity, but **architecture clarity, UX stability, and explainable engineering decisions**.

---

## What I Focus On

- **UI Architecture**: Keeping components pure and stateless; encapsulating side effects within custom hooks.
- **Predictable State**: Centralized auth and permission logic using **Guarded Initialization** to eliminate race conditions.
- **UX Edge Cases**: Robust handling of loading, empty, fallback, and error states for a bulletproof user journey.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**: Implementing focus management, keyboard flow (ESC behavior), and ARIA standards.
- **Systematic Logic**: Translating complex business rules into clean, scalable, and type-safe code.

## Selected Projects

| Project | Key Engineering Highlights | Tech Stack | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MERN Course Platform** | **Permission-driven UI** & modular validation (Joi). Implemented a single source of truth for full-stack data integrity. | MongoDB · Express · React · Node.js · JWT | [Live](https://course.tinahu.dev/) · [Code](https://github.com/yuting813/mern-project) |
| **Netflix Clone (Next.js)** | **Guarded Initialization** for Auth-Subscription sync. Focused on A11y, CLS optimization, and comprehensive fallback UX. | Next.js · TypeScript · Firebase · Stripe · Tailwind | [Live](https://stream.tinahu.dev/) · [Code](https://github.com/yuting813/netflix-clone-nextjs) |

## Engineering Highlights

- **Guarded Initialization**: Implemented a Guarded Initialization pattern to manage asynchronous auth/subscription states, effectively eliminating UI flickering and improving UX stability.
- **Permission-driven Architecture**: Designed a centralized role management system that decouples authorization logic from UI components.
- **Type-safe Engineering**: Leveraging TypeScript interfaces to define data "contracts," reducing runtime errors and improving maintainability.
- **Bulletproof UX**: Implementing explicit fallback states to ensure system stability even when third-party APIs provide incomplete data.

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recoil
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, Firestore
- **Tools & Workflow**: Git Flow, CI/CD (Vercel/Render), ESLint, Prettier, Lighthouse Audit

## Background

**From Procurement to Frontend Engineering.**
With 6 years of experience in procurement and supply chain management, I bring a unique blend of **delivery discipline, risk assessment, and systematic reasoning** to software development. I view code as a series of optimized processes where logic rigor and system stability are paramount.
